high prio: move preproc handling out of the parser completely and have it be done by the lexer
           or maybe even before lexing.
high prio: @annotation parsing for parameters and other declarations

===========================================

- Forign langauge blocks 
- Checking for initialisation functions before use of struct

-Label variables to implement cheap local 'calls'
-Git rid of real pointers and use indicies into the expression, statement and declaration table

Features:
- constructors and destructors
- intialize variables - default init with 0;
- union default initalsation is the size of the biggest member
- Slices
- SIMD intrinsics
- Support void fields

---- compiler interface ----------
- 
- backend info: SIMD_LAYOUT
                CACHE SIZES
- Halt task executions when .compiler handler is envoked
- Control/Monitoring of tasks
- Locking on tree modification such that when a property
  is queried no-other task can llok at that property until
  the modification is finished

------- task system ---------------
Tasks are transferred completely into the queue
when they are enqueued which means the discricption
the enqueuer of the task generated can go away
